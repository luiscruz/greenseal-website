     style="max-width: 200px; height: auto;">

- Technical and organizational guidance
- Tailored sustainability and efficiency roadmap
- Advanced internal enablement: workshops, keynotes, AMA sessions, and knowledge transfer
- Regular check-ins and touchpoints to monitor progress
- Delivery of actionable reports

Badge and Certification:
- All participating organizations receive a **GSP™ Verified+ In Progress** badge during the engagement, indicating active participation in the GSP™ Verified+ program.
- Achievement of the GSP™ Verified+ badge is awarded only upon successful completion of the engagement and passing a formal verification review.
- Organizations that do not meet the verification criteria at the end of the engagement will not receive the GSP™ Verified+ badge, but will retain the benefits of the engagement.

GSP™ Verified+ is designed for organizations that want to go beyond certification and actively build long-term sustainable software and AI capabilities.

The engagement provides expert support, tailored recommendations, and structured guidance to help your organization strengthen its sustainability practices. The GSP™ Verified or GSP™ Verified+ badge is not guaranteed; it depends on meeting the required criteria. The program is structured to maximize readiness and progress toward certification, empowering teams to implement best practices internally.
