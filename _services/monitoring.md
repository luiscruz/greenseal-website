Efficiency improvements only matter if they are measured, sustained, and verifiable.
GreenSeal.dev helps organizations continuously monitor the energy and cost efficiency of their AI and cloud systems, building reliable technical evidence over time.
This service provides the foundation for credible sustainability claims and formal efficiency recognition.

### What this enables:

 - Continuous energy and cost monitoring
 - Efficiency dashboards  
 - Audit-ready evidence for sustainability claims
 - Preparation for independent efficiency labels and certifications
 - Public or internal **[GSP™ (Green Software Practices™)](/gsp/)** certification

### About the Green Software Label (GSP™)

The GSP™ is GreenSeal’s efficiency label for software and AI systems that demonstrate measured and sustained performance.
It is awarded only when systems meet defined, measurement-based thresholds, and remains valid only while performance is continuously maintained.
This ensures that efficiency recognition reflects actual system behavior, not intentions or self-declared claims.

This service helps organizations move from one-off optimizations to sustained, verifiable impact, and prepares systems for efficiency recognition and labeling through GSP or independent verification.
