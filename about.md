GreenSeal is a consultancy dedicated to helping organizations reduce the environmental footprint of their software.
We combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of sustainability to deliver strategies, processes, and tools that make greener software development both practical and impactful.


# Our Mission

> Saving the planet, one software system at a time.

GreenSeal.dev works through a network-based collaboration model, connecting with researchers and industry experts across software engineering, machine learning systems, and sustainable computing.

Our mission is to integrate sustainability into the very core of software engineering and artificial intelligence. We support companies in designing and implementing processes that minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions, ensuring that digital products and AI systems are efficient, responsible, and future-proof.

**Values:** Sustainability · Innovation · Transparency

This allows us to:
- Apply state-of-the-art, peer-reviewed techniques to real-word systems
- Scale expertise according to the technical needs of each project
- Combine rigorous measurement with hands-on engineering practice

Our work is grounded in **evidence, not assumptions**: every recommendation is based on profiling, benchmarking, and validated optimization methods.


# How It All Started

GreenSeal.dev was created to close a persistent gap between sustainability research and real-world software engineering practice.

Its origins lie in academic research on energy-efficient software and artificial intelligence, initially focused on developing tools and techniques to reduce the energy footprint of software-intensive systems. As this work expanded to large-scale AI and cloud-based infrastructures within leading research environments, its practical relevance became increasingly clear.

Through industry collaborations and applied research projects, the same pattern emerged repeatedly:  
while scientifically validated methods for improving software and AI efficiency exist, they are rarely integrated into everyday engineering workflows.

This research was also translated into academic teaching in sustainable software engineering, helping train hundreds of computer science and AI students to design systems that are both high-performing and resource-efficient. Despite this growing body of knowledge, adoption in industry remained limited.

GreenSeal.dev was founded to operationalize these insights — bringing together academic rigor, engineering expertise, and industry collaboration to turn proven research into measurable, deployable impact for organizations.

# Leadership

GreenSeal was founded by [Luís Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luismirandacruz/), PhD in Computer Science and award-winning researcher in Green AI and Software Engineering. His research and consulting work focus on the sustainability of cutting-edge AI technologies, including large language models and agentic AI systems. By bridging rigorous academic insight with industry needs, GreenSeal delivers science-driven guidance designed for real-world impact.

# Our Services

- **Consulting** – Sustainability audits and tailored strategies for software and AI teams.
- **Certification** – Recognizing organizations committed to sustainable practices in software and AI.
- **Training** – Workshops and courses to build awareness and practical skills in green software and responsible AI.
- **Talks & Keynotes** – Inspiring sessions on sustainability, AI, and the future of digital technology.

# Our Vision

We envision a software and AI industry where sustainability is not an afterthought, but a standard. Every line of code and every model parameter has the potential to contribute to climate goals. GreenSeal exists to help organizations achieve that potential, whether they are building enterprise systems, deploying large language models, or experimenting with agentic AI.
